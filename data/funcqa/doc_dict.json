{
    "<add>": "<add> takes two or more numbers and computes their sum. <add> is correct when a quantity of something needs to be added to another quantity.",
    "<subtract>": "<subtract> takes two numbers and computes their difference. <subtract> is correct when a quantity needs to be taken from another quantity.",
    "<multiply>": "<multiply> takes two or more numbers and computes their product. <multiply> is correct when a quantity of something repeats over something else. It could repeat over a set amount of time, or over a given number of people or things.",
    "<divide>": "<divide> takes two numbers and computes their ratio. <divide> is correct when we want to distribute a total quantity over a number of things or people.",
    "<power>": "<power> takes two numbers and raises the first to the second. <power> is correct when something changes a little bit more each time, for example when something increases or decreases by a set percentage over time.",
    "<sqrt>": "<sqrt> takes one number and computes its square root, that is, the inverse of the square. <sqrt> is correct when we have a square and want to know its side, when we have the variance and want to know the standard deviation, or when we are explicitly asked to compute the square root.",
    "<log>": "<log> takes one number and computes its logarithm base 10. <log> is correct when we have 10^x and want to know the value of x, or when we are explicitly asked to compute the logarithm (but not the natural logarithm, which is <ln>).",
    "<ln>": "<ln> takes one number and computes its natural logarithm, that is, the inverse of the exponential function e^n. <ln> is correct when we have e^x and want to know the value of x, or when we are explicitly asked to compute the natural logarithm, or natural log (but not the logarithm without specifying natural, which is <log>).",
    "<lcm>": "<lcm> takes two or more integers and finds their least common miltiple. <lcm> is correct when we are given several quantities of something and we need to calculate the least or smallest quantity that can be divided by each of them.",
    "<gcd>": "<gcd> takes two or more integers and computes their greatest common divisor. <gcd> is correct when we are given several quantities and we need to calculate the largest, or maximum, quantity that can divide all of them.",
    "<remainder>": "<remainder> takes two integers and it computes the mod, that is, the remainder after the first integer is divided by the second integer. <remainder> is correct when we want to know how much of something will remain after we divide a quantity by another quantity.",
    "<choose>": "<choose> takes two integers n and k and it computes the number of ways that k things can be selected out of n things. The selection does not need to be in a particular order. <choose> is correct when the order of the chosen things does not matter (for example when selecting a team of people or a bunch of items).",
    "<permutate>": "<permutate> takes two integers n and k and it computes the number of possible ordered arrangements of k distinct elements selected from the n elements. <permutate> is correct when the order of the selected things matters (for example when choosing sequence, a queue or a playlist)."
